What is the game idea?
go with poe/vampire survivor type of gameplay loop idea
get loot and upgrade character
not totally roguelike so there needs to be grearing and skill tree progression
make it really simple tough

things that feels nice

- getting upgrades
- getting new abilities
- getting new weapons
- movement speed boots
- weapon upgrades with bigger dps
- defensive upgrades health armor evasion
- skill tree to alter game mechanics
- completing a boss
- strugling at hard content and getting upgrades to then beat it
- this game needs ramp up to bonkers levels of effects on the screen total rainbow vomit

core gameplay loop:

- open map
- kill enemies
- get loot
- upgrade character
- repeat

no actual inventory but a char update mechanic between maps

one thing we need to remove is inventory tetris
looting is automatic and we have only update char mechanic between maps
maps should not take that long lets start with 1-3 minute maps
gear update should not take long too but needs to have depth


nice i think we copy skills from poe and add our own twist to it
